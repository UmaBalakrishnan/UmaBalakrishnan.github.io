<li> Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of more than a million gallons of water, sand and chemical agents at high pressure down and across into horizontally drilled wells more than 10,000 feet below the surface. Injection treatments are applied to induce fractures in the subterranean formation, to enhance the productivity of natural resources. </li> <br>

<li> Pressures generated by a stimulation treatment may induce low-amplitude or low-energy seismic events and causes the rock layer to crack. As fractures are generated, hydrocarbon may begin to flow from the fractures which maybe captured via the borehole. </li> <br>

<li> We developed a sophisticated higher order numerical scheme to improve the uniform accuracy of convergence using finite volume / difference methods (FVM/FDM) for 
fluid flow in complex fracture network. Accuracy of the computational physics code has been verified rigorously using exact and manufactured solutions (MMS).</li> <br>

<li> Developed a histogram based image processing algorithm to monitor the proppant transport in formation when contained in a fracturing fluid matrix </li>

<li> Nanotechnology in medicine currently being developed involves employing nanoparticles to deliver drugs to specific types of cells, such as cancer or tumor cells. Particles are engineered so that they are attracted to diseased cells, which allows direct treatment of those diseased cells. This technique reduces damage to healthy cells in the body and allows for earlier detection of disease. </li> <br>

<li> Clinical optimization of drug transport first requires an accurate description of carrier motion in the bloodstream and near endothelial cells. A synergistic computational approach is suitable to determine both the translational and rotational motions of a nanocarrier. </li> <br>

<li> Designed a three dimensional mathematical modeling of the temporal multiscale problem of hydrodynamic and microscopic interactions mediating nanoparticle motion and adhesion in a targeted drug delivery using Markovian fluctuating hydrodynamics, non-Markovian Langevin approach and hybrid approaches. Resulting stochastic partial differential equations (PDE) have been solved numerically using direct numerical simulation employing an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) based finite element method (FEM). </li>

Even blinking of an eye involves motion over a thin corneal fluid film. </li> <br>

<li> Spin coating is a method to obtain coatings with defined thickness in a huge range (from several nanometers up to millimetres). This is one of the fundamental micro/nano fabrication methods widely employed in obtaining uniform thin films on substrates such as photolithography in the fabrication of microelectronic devices, phosphor coatings on television screens, photoresist films on silicon wafers for integrated circuits, magnetic storage disks, magnetic paint coating on the substrates, deposition of surface coatings on optical mirrors, CDs, DVDs and Blu-rays. </li> <br>

<li> The spin coating process involves the acceleration of a liquid solution on a rotating substrate and is characterized by a balance of centrifugal forces (spin speed) and viscous forces (solution viscosity). The coating thickness is adjusted by the spinning speed, spinning time and the viscosity of the liquid. Films created by this way have been found to be consistent and reproducible in thickness. </li>

<li> The final thickness of the film and the uniformity in the thickness are central issues in these applications. They are observed to be dependent on several process parameters, most notably the rotational speed, the viscosity of the liquid film, different spin-up protocols, heat and mass transfer processes, surface tension effects, the rate of solvent evaporation and so on. Developed a sophisticated finite difference computational code to determine the final thickness of the film on the substrate and its stability. </li>
